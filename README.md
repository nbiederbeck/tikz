# ti*k*z-snippets

Providing some (not so) useful ti*k*z snippets done sometimes for something.
**Sharing is caring.**


## Description
Running `make` in the one of the subdirectories will build
a PDF containing the ti*k*zpicture (assuming `lualatex` is installed).
Using `\usepackage{standalone}` in the preamble of your latex project gives
you the ability to `\input{main.tex}` the ti*k*zpicture of your choice.
